# Quick Start Alternative - Create Fresh React Native Project

Since we're missing some React Native project files, here's the fastest way to get the app running:

## Option 1: Create Fresh React Native Project (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to your desktop
cd /Users/taoshimomura/Desktop/dev

# Create a new React Native project
npx react-native init WillCounterApp --template react-native-template-typescript

# Navigate to the new project
cd WillCounterApp

# Replace the default App.tsx with our Will Counter app
```

Then copy our App.tsx content into the new project:

```bash
# Copy our app code
cp /Users/taoshimomura/Desktop/dev/will-counter/frontend/App.tsx ./App.tsx
```

## Option 2: Use Expo (Easiest)

```bash
# Create Expo app
npx create-expo-app WillCounterExpo --template

cd WillCounterExpo

# Copy our App.tsx content
```

## Option 3: Fix Current Project

Create the missing project structure manually:

```bash
cd /Users/taoshimomura/Desktop/dev/will-counter/frontend

# Create directories
mkdir -p ios android

# Initialize React Native project in current directory
npx react-native init . --template react-native-template-typescript --skip-install
```

## Recommended: Option 1 (Fresh Project)

This is the quickest way to get the app running:

1. **Create new project:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/taoshimomura/Desktop/dev
   npx react-native init WillCounterApp --template react-native-template-typescript
   cd WillCounterApp
   ```

2. **Replace App.tsx with our code:**
   ```bash
   # Copy the content from our App.tsx file into the new project's App.tsx
   ```

3. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # In new terminal:
   npm run ios
   ```

## What's in Our App.tsx

Our simplified Will Counter app includes:
- ✅ Login/logout flow
- ✅ Will power counter with big + button  
- ✅ Count display (000 format)
- ✅ Motivational messages
- ✅ Basic statistics
- ✅ Clean, professional UI
