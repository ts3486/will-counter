# Security Vulnerabilities Report

## Executive Summary

This report details critical security vulnerabilities discovered in the Will Counter application codebase and the remediation steps taken to address them.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Committed Sensitive Environment File (.env)
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** FIXED

The `.env` file containing real API keys and secrets was committed to version control.

**Exposed Secrets:**
- Supabase Anonymous Key
- Supabase Service Role Key (full admin access)
- Auth0 Client Secret
- Auth0 Domain and Client ID

**Impact:** Full compromise of backend services, potential data breach, unauthorized access to authentication systems.

### 2. Hardcoded API Keys in Source Code
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** FIXED

Multiple source files contained hardcoded API keys and secrets:

**Affected Files:**
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts`: Hardcoded Supabase keys
- `api/src/main/kotlin/com/willcounter/api/config/DatabaseConfig.kt`: Hardcoded service role key as fallback
- `frontend/src/config/auth0.ts`: Hardcoded Auth0 credentials

**Impact:** Secrets exposed in source code, build artifacts, and potentially in client-side bundles.

### 3. Build Artifacts Containing Secrets
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** FIXED

Build artifacts in `frontend/dist/` contained compiled JavaScript with embedded secrets.

**Impact:** Secrets exposed in deployable artifacts and potentially served to clients.

### 4. Insufficient .gitignore Rules
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** FIXED

The `.gitignore` file was insufficient to prevent secret leakage.

## Remediation Actions Taken

### 1. Environment File Security
- ✅ Removed `.env` file from Git tracking using `git rm --cached .env`
- ✅ Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent future commits of sensitive files
- ✅ Updated `.env.example` with proper placeholder values

### 2. Source Code Hardening
- ✅ Replaced all hardcoded secrets with environment variable lookups
- ✅ Added validation warnings when required environment variables are missing
- ✅ Implemented graceful failure handling for missing configuration

### 3. Build Artifact Cleanup
- ✅ Removed existing build artifacts containing secrets
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude build directories

### 4. Configuration Management
- ✅ Separated frontend and backend environment variables appropriately
- ✅ Used `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` prefix for client-side environment variables
- ✅ Maintained server-side only variables for sensitive operations

## Updated Environment Variable Structure

### Backend (API) Variables:
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
AUTH0_DOMAIN=
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=
```

### Frontend (Expo) Variables:
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
EXPO_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN=
EXPO_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=
```

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **No Secrets in Source Code:** All configuration now uses environment variables
2. **Graceful Degradation:** Applications warn but don't crash when environment variables are missing
3. **Separation of Concerns:** Frontend only has access to public-safe credentials
4. **Build Artifact Security:** Build directories are properly excluded from version control

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Secret Rotation:** Rotate all exposed API keys immediately after deployment
2. **Environment Management:** Use a secure secret management system for production
3. **CI/CD Security:** Implement secret scanning in CI/CD pipelines
4. **Code Review:** Establish mandatory security reviews for configuration changes
5. **Access Control:** Implement least-privilege access for API keys
6. **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring for unusual API usage patterns

## Verification Steps

To verify the security fixes:

1. Confirm no secrets exist in source code: `grep -r "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9" . --exclude-dir=node_modules`
2. Verify environment variable usage: Check that applications fail gracefully without environment variables
3. Confirm .env is not tracked: `git ls-files | grep -E "\.env$"`
4. Validate .gitignore effectiveness: Test that sensitive files are properly ignored

## Immediate Action Required

**CRITICAL:** All exposed API keys and secrets must be rotated immediately:
- [ ] Regenerate Supabase API keys
- [ ] Reset Auth0 client secret
- [ ] Update production environment variables
- [ ] Verify no unauthorized access occurred during exposure period
