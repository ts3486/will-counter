# Will Counter Application - Security Vulnerability Assessment Report

**Generated:** 2025-08-04  
**Assessment Scope:** Full application stack (Frontend, API, Project Configuration)  
**Risk Level:** üö® **CRITICAL** - Application not suitable for production deployment

---

## Executive Summary

This security assessment has identified **multiple critical vulnerabilities** in the Will Counter application that pose significant security risks. The most severe issue is the hardcoded Supabase service role key in the frontend code, which provides administrative access to the entire database. Additionally, unprotected API endpoints, permissive CORS configuration, and various other security flaws make this application unsuitable for production deployment without immediate remediation.

**Key Statistics:**
- **Critical Vulnerabilities:** 6
- **High Severity Issues:** 4  
- **Medium Severity Issues:** 6
- **Low Severity Issues:** 3

## üö® Critical Vulnerabilities (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. Hardcoded Supabase Service Role Key in Frontend Source Code
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**File:** `frontend/src/services/api.ts:4-6`  
**CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)

```typescript
const SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im1yYnl2b2NjYXlxeGRkd3Juc3llIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NjAwNjYzOCwiZXhwIjoyMDYxNTgyNjM4fQ.XcWsv0uJ4UfrL4usgwUmk40Ktq93u-m8lWQ_V3XlgKA';
```

**Impact:** Complete database compromise. The service role key bypasses all Row Level Security policies and provides administrative access to all tables, allowing unauthorized users to read, modify, or delete any data.

**Exploitation:** Any user with access to the compiled application can extract this key and gain full database access.

### 2. Hardcoded Supabase Credentials in API Backend
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**File:** `api/src/main/kotlin/com/willcounter/api/config/DatabaseConfig.kt:17-18`

```kotlin
val supabaseUrl = System.getenv("SUPABASE_URL") ?: "https://mrbyvoccayqxddwrnsye.supabase.co"
val supabaseKey = System.getenv("SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY") ?: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

**Impact:** Backup credentials hardcoded in source code, exposing production database access even if environment variables are properly configured.

### 3. Hardcoded Auth0 Production Credentials
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Files:** 
- `api/src/main/kotlin/com/willcounter/api/config/Auth0Config.kt:10-11`
- `frontend/src/config/auth0.ts:7-8`

```kotlin
private val domain = System.getenv("AUTH0_DOMAIN") ?: "dev-fetoxen063fxtlxz.jp.auth0.com"
```

**Impact:** Production Auth0 credentials exposed in source code, enabling authentication bypass and account takeover attacks.

### 4. Insecure CORS Configuration - Any Origin Allowed
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**File:** `api/src/main/kotlin/com/willcounter/api/Application.kt:58`

```kotlin
anyHost()
```

**Impact:** Allows cross-origin requests from any domain, enabling malicious websites to make authenticated requests on behalf of users.

### 5. Row Level Security Intentionally Bypassed
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**File:** `frontend/src/services/api.ts:46,105,199,304,322,332,349`

```typescript
const getSupabaseHeaders = (useServiceRole: boolean = false) => {
    const key = useServiceRole ? SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY : SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;
```

**Impact:** Application intentionally uses service role key to bypass RLS, completely undermining database security architecture.

### 6. Unprotected Sensitive API Endpoints
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Files:**
- `api/src/main/kotlin/com/willcounter/api/routes/UserRoutes.kt:97-125`
- `api/src/main/kotlin/com/willcounter/api/routes/WillCountRoutes.kt:101-131`

**Impact:** User profile and statistics endpoints accessible without authentication, allowing unauthorized access to personal data.

---

## üî¥ High Severity Issues

### 7. Hardcoded Test User in Production Code
**Severity:** HIGH  
**File:** `frontend/src/services/api.ts:40-41,97-98,192-193`

```typescript
const testUserAuth0Id = 'test-user-1';
const testUserUuid = await this.ensureUserExists(testUserAuth0Id, 'test@example.com');
```

**Impact:** Production code contains test user credentials, creating potential authentication bypass.

### 8. Excessive Logging of Sensitive Data
**Severity:** HIGH  
**File:** `frontend/src/services/api.ts` (multiple locations)

**Impact:** Console logs contain sensitive user data, database IDs, and system internals that could be exploited.

### 9. Client-Side Database Access Pattern
**Severity:** HIGH  
**File:** `frontend/src/services/api.ts:8-9`

```typescript
const useSupabaseDirectly = true; // Set to true to bypass backend
```

**Impact:** Frontend bypasses backend validation and connects directly to database, exposing database structure.

### 10. Information Disclosure in Error Messages
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Files:** Multiple API routes

**Impact:** Stack traces and internal error details exposed to clients, potentially revealing system architecture.

---

## üü° Medium Severity Issues

### 11. Insecure Data Storage in AsyncStorage
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**File:** `frontend/src/components/settings/SettingsScreen.tsx:98,146`

**Impact:** Sensitive user preferences stored in plain text AsyncStorage instead of SecureStore.

### 12. JWT Token Exposure in Error Logging  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**File:** `frontend/src/utils/errorHandler.ts:63-67`

**Impact:** Potential JWT token exposure in error logs.

### 13. Development Tools Potentially Enabled in Production
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**File:** `frontend/src/store/store.ts:22`

**Impact:** Redux DevTools could expose application state in production.

### 14. Missing Input Validation
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Files:** Various components and API routes

**Impact:** No validation on email formats, UUID formats, or request payload sizes.

### 15. Weak JWT Key Retrieval
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**File:** `api/src/main/kotlin/com/willcounter/api/config/Auth0Config.kt:20`

```kotlin
val jwk = jwkProvider.get("latest")
```

**Impact:** Using "latest" instead of specific key ID may lead to key confusion attacks.

### 16. Missing Rate Limiting
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** No rate limiting on any endpoints, vulnerable to brute force and DDoS attacks.

---

## üü† Lower Severity Issues

### 17. Missing Security Headers
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** No security headers configured (HSTS, CSP, X-Content-Type-Options).

### 18. Missing Certificate Pinning
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** App vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 19. Incomplete Audit Logging
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Sensitive operations not properly logged for security monitoring.

## Long-term Security Recommendations

1. **Security Architecture Review**
   - Implement defense-in-depth strategies
   - Regular security audits and assessments
   - Establish security development lifecycle

2. **Monitoring and Detection**
   - Implement security monitoring and alerting
   - Add suspicious activity detection
   - Regular vulnerability scanning

## Conclusion

The Will Counter application currently contains multiple critical security vulnerabilities that make it unsuitable for production deployment. The most severe issue is the hardcoded Supabase service role key, which provides complete database access to anyone with the compiled application.

**Recommendation:** **DO NOT DEPLOY** this application to production until all critical and high-severity vulnerabilities have been addressed. The security fixes outlined in Phase 1 of the remediation plan are mandatory before any production deployment.

The application shows good security practices in some areas (proper gitignore, CI/CD security scanning, environment variable structure), but the critical vulnerabilities overshadow these positive elements.

**Estimated Remediation Time:** 2-3 weeks for critical fixes, 4-6 weeks for complete security hardening.
