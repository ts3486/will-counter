## Review Guidelines

### Backend (Kotlin) Review Points
- Proper use of Ktor features
- Database transactions handled correctly
- Exception handling is comprehensive
- Logging is appropriate (no sensitive data)
- API responses are consistent
- Authentication middleware is used
- Input validation on all endpoints

### Frontend (React Native) Review Points
- React hooks used correctly
- State management follows patterns
- Component lifecycle handled properly
- Error boundaries implemented
- Performance optimizations applied
- Accessibility features included
- TypeScript types are accurate

### Database Review Points
- Schema changes have migrations
- Indexes are appropriate
- Relationships are correct
- Constraints are in place
- Queries are optimized
- Data integrity maintained

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Security Issues
```kotlin
// ❌ Bad: No input validation
fun createUser(name: String) {
    database.insert("INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('$name')")
}

// ✅ Good: Prepared statement with validation
fun createUser(name: String) {
    require(name.isNotBlank()) { "Name cannot be empty" }
    require(name.length <= 100) { "Name too long" }
    database.insert("INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (?)") {
        this[0] = name
    }
}
```

### Performance Issues
```typescript
// ❌ Bad: Unnecessary re-renders
const Component = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    const expensiveValue = calculateExpensive(someData); // Runs on every render
    return <div>{expensiveValue}</div>;
};

// ✅ Good: Memoized calculation
const Component = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => calculateExpensive(someData), [someData]);
    return <div>{expensiveValue}</div>;
};
```

### Style Issues
```typescript
// ❌ Bad: Inconsistent naming
const get_user_data = async (userId: string) => {
    const userData = await fetchUserData(userId);
    return userData;
};

// ✅ Good: Consistent camelCase
const getUserData = async (userId: string): Promise<UserData> => {
    return await fetchUserData(userId);
};
```

## Approval Criteria

### Must Fix (Blocking)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Functional bugs
- Breaking changes without migration
- Performance regressions
- Style guide violations
- Missing error handling

### Should Fix (Non-blocking)
- Code duplication
- Suboptimal performance
- Missing documentation
- Inconsistent patterns
- Unused imports

### Nice to Have
- Additional optimizations
- Refactoring opportunities
- Enhanced readability
- Better naming

## Communication Protocol
- Always prefix messages with [CR]
- Be specific about required vs suggested changes
- Provide concrete examples for fixes
- Reference file names and line numbers
- Explain the "why" behind feedback
- Acknowledge good practices when seen
