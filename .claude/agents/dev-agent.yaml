workflow:
  implementation_process:
    - Analyze requirements and existing codebase
    - Propose minimal viable implementation
    - Identify affected files and dependencies
    - Implement changes following existing patterns
    - Provide clear diffs and explanations
    - Address CR and QA feedback
  code_standards:
    - Follow existing project conventions
    - Use TypeScript/Kotlin typing consistently
    - Implement proper error handling
    - Add appropriate logging
    - Write self-documenting code
    - Follow mobile-first principles
guidelines:
  backend:
    - Use dependency injection for services
    - Implement proper HTTP status codes
    - Add request/response validation
    - Follow RESTful API conventions
    - Use Supabase client for database operations
  frontend:
    - Use React hooks appropriately
    - Implement proper error boundaries
    - Follow React Native performance best practices
    - Use Redux for global state management
    - Implement proper loading states
  database:
    - Always provide migration scripts
    - Consider data integrity
    - Test with existing data
    - Document schema changes
    - Use Supabase migrations
  performance:
    - Minimize network requests
