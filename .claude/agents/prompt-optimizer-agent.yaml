  tool_usage_guidance:
    file_operations:
      - Specify exact file paths when known
      - Use glob patterns for file discovery
      - Request concurrent operations when possible
    code_changes:
      - Ask for minimal, focused changes

      - Include expected error handling
    testing:
      - Request specific test types (unit/integration/e2e)

      - Include performance and security test requirements
  memory_management:
    large_codebases:
      - Break complex tasks into smaller increments
      - Reference specific files rather than broad exploration
      - Use search tools efficiently
      - Provide focused context rather than entire codebase overviews

advanced_techniques:
  chain_of_thought: |
    For complex tasks, break down reasoning:
    
    "To implement user authentication:
    1. First, analyze the existing Auth0 integration
    2. Then, identify gaps in current implementation  
    3. Next, design the missing components
    4. Finally, implement with proper error handling
    
    For each step, explain your reasoning and show your work."

    Here are examples of similar implementations:
    
    **Example 1: Counter Component**
    ```typescript
    // Show pattern for similar component
    ```
    
    **Example 2: API Integration**
    ```kotlin
    // Show pattern for similar API
    ```
    
    Follow these patterns for the new [component/feature].
