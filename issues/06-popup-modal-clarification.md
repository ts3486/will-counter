# Implement popup/modal functionality for [specific use case]

## Description
**⚠️ CLARIFICATION NEEDED:** The original task "create popup for" is incomplete. This needs clarification from the product owner about what specific popup functionality is required.

## Possible Interpretations
1. **Onboarding popup** - Welcome new users with app instructions
2. **Achievement popup** - Celebrate when users reach goals
3. **Reminder popup** - Periodic reminders to use the app
4. **Update popup** - Notify users of app updates or new features
5. **Tip popup** - Show helpful tips about willpower tracking
6. **Confirmation popup** - Generic confirmation dialog system

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Clarify with product owner what specific popup is needed
2. Define the popup's purpose, trigger conditions, and content
3. Design the popup's visual appearance and interaction
4. Implement based on clarified requirements

## Technical Considerations
- React Native Modal component
- Custom popup/overlay system
- Animation and timing
- Dismissal mechanisms
- Persistent storage for "don't show again" preferences

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Requirement clarification obtained**
- [ ] Popup purpose and triggers defined
